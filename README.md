# Chakra UI Devicons

This package contains components for custom icons from the [devicon](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/) library.  The library creates Icon components for use in Chakra UI projects.  Feel free to fork this to create your own icons using other React packages.

This package uses plop.js to autogenerate icon components for react.  The individual components are contained with the components folder, and can be imported through the module.

## Installation

To install Chakra UI Devicons run:

```
npm i chakra-ui-devicon
```

## Generate Components

If you need to generate new components, you can run the script `generateComponents.sh`.  Make sure to chmod the file using `chmod 700 generateComponents.sh`.  This will automatically generate new components, as well as update index.js.
